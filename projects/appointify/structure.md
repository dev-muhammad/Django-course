# Appointify

Appointify is a cutting-edge appointment booking app designed to simplify the process of scheduling and managing service appointments. With Appointify, you can say goodbye to the hassle of endless phone calls and lines when trying to secure appointments for various services.


## Functionality

1) User Management: Users can register and log in to the Appointify app. They can update their profile information, including contact details and profile photo.

2) Service Management: Providers can create services, including their name, description, pricing, duration, and category. Each service is associated with a provider and can have a photo.

3) Provider Management: Providers can create profiles with their name, contact details, specialization, working hours, and photo. They can set their availability for each day of the week and define breaks. Providers can also manage their preferred workers, categories, and services.

4) Worker Management: Providers can create workers who can perform specific services. Workers have their own profiles with name, contact details, and photo. They can be associated with one provider and can perform multiple services.

5) Appointment Booking: Users can browse services and book appointments with providers. They can select a specific service, date, and time. The appointment is associated with the user, provider, service, and worker. Users can provide additional details during the booking process.

6) Appointment State Management: Appointments have a state field that indicates their status, such as "booked," "confirmed," "cancelled," or "completed." The state field helps track the progress of appointments.

7) Payment Processing: Users can prepay for appointments. The payment model includes the amount and status fields. Integration with a payment gateway or API is required for payment processing.

8) Notification Management: Users receive notifications for various events, such as appointment confirmations, reminders, cancellations, and referral notifications. The notification model includes the user, message, and timestamp.

9) Review and Rating: Users can leave reviews and ratings for providers and services. Reviews include a rating and comment. Providers can use this feedback to improve their services.

10) Cancellation Handling: Users can request appointment cancellations and provide a reason. Cancellations are associated with the appointment and user. The cancellation model includes the reason and timestamp.

11) Availability Management: Providers can define their regular working hours and breaks using the "Availability" and "Break" models. This allows them to specify when they are available for appointments and when they are on breaks.

12) Holiday Management: Providers can mark specific dates as holidays using the "Holiday" model. This allows them to indicate when they are not available for appointments due to holidays or other reasons.

13) Referral Program: The referral model allows users to refer others to use the Appointify app. Referrals are associated with the referring user, referred user, and referral code. Users may receive rewards or bonuses for successful referrals.

14) Working Hour Exceptions: Providers can handle temporary changes or exceptions to their regular working hours by using the "WorkingHourException" model. This allows them to accommodate unique situations like extended hours, early closures, or special events.

15) Advanced Search and Filtering: Users can search for providers or services based on various criteria such as location, ratings, availability, and categories. Advanced search and filtering options enhance the user experience and help users find the most suitable providers and services.

16) Data Export and Reporting: The app allows exporting data and generating reports for various purposes, such as appointment history, revenue analytics, user statistics, and photo usage. This helps providers and administrators gain insights into their business performance and make informed decisions.

17) Social Media Sharing: Users can easily share their appointments, reviews, and referral codes on popular social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter. Social media integration makes sharing effortless and increases user engagement.

18) Mobile Push Notifications: The app integrates with push notification services like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) to send mobile push notifications to users. Notifications can include appointment updates, reminders, or important announcements.

These functionalities work together to provide a comprehensive appointment and service booking platform, ensuring a seamless experience for users, providers, and workers.
